    <p>
      NightPDF is a electron based application that allows one to read PDF files with dark mode. It has 3 default filters(monochrome, sepia &amp; redeye) along with a option to generate a custom filter along with no filter. NightPDF has a simplistic design that makes it intuitive to use.

    <p>typescript 2(electric bogaloo)</p>
    <p>this has been a verrrrrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyy long time coming. I've tried several times with various approaches(Lunarequest/NightPDF-ng and Lunarequest/nightpdf-nx) I am happy to say these both approaches have been dropped for a much much simpler solution using tsc and rollup!</p>
    <p>its been a hard journey getting to a typescript rewrite of NightPDF. I hope everyone can enjoy benefit from the rewrite</p>
